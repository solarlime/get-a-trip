        "Kas is everything that a typical Mediterranean seaside resort in Turkey should be. White washed houses cascade down the winding mountain roads to show the way to beautiful beaches and a harbor that reminds you that life is in fact quite good and while in Kas, the best thing to do is to adapt quickly to the Mediterranean lifestyle.",
        "Many of the houses in Kas are surrounded with pink bougainvillea flowers that immediately make you notice the influence of Greek architecture in some of the older properties, typically the wooden shutters, narrow streets and large terraces for enjoying the mid-day sun.",
        "Like many towns in this area, there used to be a huge Greek population until 1923 when there was an exchange of citizens between Greece and Turkey. That was a turbulent time for the area, when people were unsure of the future. I think they would be proud now, to know that Kas is making a name for itself as a “must visit” Mediterranean destination in Turkey."
